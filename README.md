# Bagels

A recreation of the Bagels logic game.

## Description

Bagels is a deduction game in which the user is asked to guess a randomly generated 3-digit code with 10 guesses. Based on what the user guesses, they are given on of the three clues: Bagels, Pico, and Fermi. Bagels meens that none of the digits are correct, Pico means one of the digits is correct but in the wrong position, and Fermi means one of the digits is correct and in the right position.

This version also allows for the user to select how many digits are in the code, from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 10, as well as choose how many guesses they get, at a minimum of 1.
